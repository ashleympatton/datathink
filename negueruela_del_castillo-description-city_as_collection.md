# The City as Collection: building an augmented database for the humanities and social sciences.
 
Keywords: urban landscape, monuments, public space, city, visualization, data, images, collection, database
 
Digitalization is ubiquitous and pervasive. All our approaches, concepts, and methods will surely be permeated by the digital if they are not already. Within the humanities and social sciences, and particularly in the fields of architecture and architectural and urban history, there is an urgent need to rethink the way we build pragmatic, linked and interoperable databases from the ground up, leveraging connections to curated collections and controlled vocabularies.
 
With this block winter school, we propose a hands-on approach to engaging with a digital workflow and data pipeline for the collection, processing, contextualization, visualization and spatialization of a database of public monuments in the city of Rome. The goal of the workshop is to explore the different phases in a connected and holistic manner so as to better conceive what it takes to build an augmented database fit for the stated research purposes and the challenges faced by future-proof research infrastructure.
 
The winter school is conceived in a workshop format, structured by a series of connected exercises that explore different items of the workflow, combined with lectures and presentations that contextualize these in the state of the art and contribute to enriching the collective reflections on the shortcomings and challenges of current data infrastructure efforts for the humanities and social sciences.  We depart from an entry point based on the visual and cartographic, and we gradually expand it to other modalities, building a context to the data collection efforts by the participants through connections to existing historical collections.
As an entry point to the very rich and historically dense urban landscape of the city of Rome, we will use Giuseppe Vasi’s *Itinerario istruttivo per ritrovare con facilità tutte le Magnificenze di Roma e di alcune città, e castelli suburbani*, published in 1763?, which, accompanied by the series of etchings etchings on the monuments of Rome (Sulle Magnificenze di Roma Antica e Moderna) published over ten books, constitute one of the main reference guides to the Rome of the Grand Tour.

## Program
The winter school is structured into distinct thematic and methodological approaches per day. These themes serve as a motto to englobe yet complementary. The sequence of the themes by day is conceived in a logical sequence, but each exercise and the accompanying theoretical inputs can be taken separately.

As an entry point, we will use one of the most renowned guidebooks to the city of Rome and its treasures: Giuseppe Vasi’s Itinerario Istruttivo (1777). We will follow the route suggested for the first day (*la prima giornata*), which will serve as a main vehicle to articulate the different exercises and reunite the diversity of data collected and analyzed on a set of shred locations on the map.

### Day 1: Geospatial Data-Encoding Past Environments
We will start by considering how to work with historical cartographic sources and incorporate them into a digital workflow. With inputs by Klaus Werner (BHMPI), and Paul Guhennec, we will learn what historical maps are of paradigmatic importance for the study and analysis of urban and artistic heritage in the city of Rome, especially considering our use of Vasi’s Itinerario. We will learn about the digitalization of these sources and how to integrate the resulting raster digital images into an online platform that we can use for our excursions and data collection. We will also learn about how to approach the vectorization of these raster images to extract polygons and lines for the objects in the map. Moreover, we will see how those objects have already been entered and documented elsewhere and how we can connect to that information using a linked data approach and Wikidata.
To close the day, Prof Frédéric Kaplan from EPFL will give a keynote lecture at 18:00 entitled, "Urban Systems and Urban Spatio-Temporal Navigation”. The lecture is open to the public and will also be streamed via Hertziana’s Vimeo channel. Afterward, an aperitif will be served in the tempietto of the Villino Stroganoff.

### Day 2: Historical Digital Twins and Sensing the Contemporary City
On the second day, we will walk through the streets of Rome following the itinerary suggested by Vasi for the *prima giornata* with the aid of historical cartographical sources. Participants will be asked to document the route in sections by groups with their smartphones and other means, capturing photographs, and taking notes of relevant aspects derived from their research statements. In addition, we will have the possibility of capturing environmental data along the itinerary with portable sensor kits. These data will be integrated into the digital map during the hands-on session later that day.
In the afternoon, Elisabbeta Scirocco from the Department of Tanja Michalsky at BHMPI and Alessandro Adamou, Digital Humanities Researcher at BHMPI will present to us the project “Mapping Sacred Spaces”.

Later, we will move to a workshop format where together with Javier Argota we will see what possibilities are there to explore regarding environmental sensing and we will collectively explore and discuss what types of synergies or emergent questions arose when combining this with other approaches such as historical, cultural heritage focused, and so on.

### Day 3: Reimagining Links between Past and Present
On the morning of the third day, we will have Paolo Rosati from Università di Roma "La Sapienza”, give us a lecture on the techniques and uses of photogrammetry for cultural heritage. In the afternoon, Prof Renata Ago and Domizia D’Erasmo, also from La Sapienza, will give a lecture on some case studies using historical GIS methodologies and Alessandro Adamou and Martin Raspe from BHMPI will explain to us the approaches towards embracing a linked data approach and knowledge graph engineering for connecting legacy databases at the Hertziana.

In the afternoon, we will explore a more speculative approach with Iacopo Neri and Darío Negueruela, using state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion) to reimagine past and alternative past representations of the urban landscape and landmarks.

### Day 4: Contemporary approaches of Research Infrastructure: SARI
This day will be devoted to exploring cutting-edge contemporary approaches to research infrastructure thanks to Thomas Hänsli, Managing Director of Swiss Art research Infrastructure SARI. In the afternoon, Andre Gattas, also at SARI will help us conduct an exercise of quality control and data alignment. In addition, we will be working on refining and integrating the work of previous days into the collective interactive online map.

### Day 5: Discussion and Wrap up
This day in the morning Pietro Liuzzo from BHMPI will share his reflections of the need and usefulness of using API access to established and renowned accessible online collections in a thoughtful and sustainable way. In addition, he will provide an access point for the participants to explore the assets of the Photographic collection of the Bibliotheca Hertziana and find entries relevant to the landmarks studied along our route in Rome.
